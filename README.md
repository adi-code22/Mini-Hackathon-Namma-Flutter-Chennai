# The Math Alarm

## 🏆 Done for 4hr Mini Hackathon - Namma Flutter Chennai

### 🧠 No Snooze, No Shortcuts!

I built this app during the **4-hour Namma Flutter | Flutter Chennai Mini Hackathon** to help you wake up and stay awake! Here's what it does:

### 📋 How It Works:
1. **Set your alarm time** - The alarm rings at your designated time, and there's no escape.
2. **Solve 5 math puzzles** - To turn it off, you need to solve **five** brain-stimulating math puzzles.
3. **Wake up fully** - The puzzles are designed to activate your brain, ensuring you're wide awake before you start your day.
4. **No cheating!** - There's no snooze button and no shortcuts. The puzzles will keep you engaged long enough to ensure you're ready to take on the day.

### ✨ Features:
- **5 puzzles in a row**: Solve all 5 before the alarm stops ringing.
- **Challenge your brain**: The puzzles are tough but not impossible, keeping you mentally sharp!
- **Customizable alarm time**: Set the alarm to ring whenever you want, and let the puzzles begin.
